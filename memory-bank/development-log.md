*   **Summary:** A concise, one-sentence summary of the activity and its outcome.
*   **Details:**
    *   (Provide a more detailed narrative here. Use bullet points for clarity.)
*   **Outcome:**

## Log Entries

*   **Date:** 2025-07-11
*   **Author(s):** Benjamin Pequet
*   **Type:** Milestone
*   **Summary:** Developed and refactored the core `password_backup.sh` script, externalizing utility functions and completing the primary feature set.
*   **Details:**
    *   Wrote the full implementation of the `password_backup.sh` script, including logic for finding the newest version of files matching a given pattern.
    *   Refactored logging and user-messaging functions into `scripts/utils/logging_utils.sh` and `scripts/utils/messaging_utils.sh` to improve modularity.
    *   Added a dependency check for `hostname`.
    *   Created `scripts/EXAMPLE_OUTPUT.txt` to serve as a reference for the script's output.
*   **Outcome:**
    *   The script is now feature-complete and robust.
    *   The project has moved from initial development into the documentation and refinement phase.
*   **Relevant Files/Links:**
    *   `scripts/password_backup.sh`
    *   `scripts/utils/logging_utils.sh`
    *   `scripts/utils/messaging_utils.sh`

*   **Date:** 2025-07-10
*   **Author(s):** Benjamin Pequet
*   **Type:** Milestone
*   **Summary:** Completed the full initialization of the Memory Bank and clarified the project's core use case.
*   **Details:**
    *   Populated all files within the `memory-bank/` directory with project-specific context for the DLS Password Backup script.
    *   Clarified the key architectural difference: this is an on-demand, portable script, not an automated, installed service like `dls-sync-drives`.
    *   Corrected an initial error by creating a properly named and formatted kickoff summary in the `inbox/`.
*   **Outcome:**
    *   The project now has a complete and accurate contextual foundation in the Memory Bank.
    *   The project is ready to move from the setup phase into active development, starting with the `README.md`.
*   **Relevant Files/Links:**
    *   `memory-bank/`

*   **Date:** 2025-06-20
*   **Author(s):** System
*   **Type:** Milestone
*   **Summary:** Project initialized from boilerplate and ready for customization.
*   **Details:**
    *   This is the first entry, automatically populated upon project initialization.
    *   The project structure and memory bank files were created by cloning the boilerplate.
    *   The next step is to review the `memory-bank/` files and customize them for this project's specific context.
*   **Outcome:**
    *   A clean, structured project environment is now in place.
    *   All boilerplate templates and AI rules are ready for user configuration.
*   **Relevant Files/Links:**
    *   `README.md`
    *   `memory-bank/`
