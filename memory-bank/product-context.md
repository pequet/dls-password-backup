# Product Context

## 1. Problem Statement

*   **Problem being solved for target audience?** *(Be specific)*

    Users with critical password databases synced via cloud services lack a simple, automated, and robust way to maintain an additional, versioned local backup on a separate physical medium (like a USB drive). This creates a single point of failure if cloud accounts are compromised or simultaneously unavailable.

*   **Importance/benefits of solving it?**

    Solving this provides a critical layer of "Controlled Redundancy," protecting against catastrophic data loss. It gives the user peace of mind that their most sensitive data is securely backed up in a separate, offline-capable location under their direct control.

## 2. Proposed Solution

*   **How will this project solve the problem(s)?** *(Core concept)*

    The project will provide a simple, elegant command-line script that is run on-demand. It intelligently finds the latest versions of specified password databases from their cloud-synced locations and copies them to a local, user-defined backup directory, which is likely located on the same portable drive as the script itself.

*   **Key features delivering the solution?**
    *   Configuration is managed via a simple `password-backup.config` text file.
    *   The script can handle wildcard patterns (e.g., `Backup-*.kdbx`) to find the most recent backup files.
    *   It uses `rsync` for efficient and reliable file transfers.
    *   It provides clear logging and on-screen feedback for each run.
    *   A lockfile mechanism prevents accidental concurrent runs.

## 3. How It Should Work (User Experience Goals)

*   **Ideal user experience?** *(What should it feel like?)*

    The experience should be simple and tangible. The user connects their encrypted backup drive, unlocks it, and runs a single command (`./scripts/password_backup.sh`). They receive immediate, clear feedback that their password databases have been securely copied to the drive. It's a deliberate, on-demand action, not a background process.

*   **Non-negotiable UX principles?**
    *   **Reliability:** The script must be robust and handle common errors (e.g., a source file not found) without failing unexpectedly.
    *   **Transparency:** Logging and on-screen messages must be clear and informative.
    *   **Simplicity:** Configuration should be trivial for a technical user, and running the script should be a single, straightforward command.
    *   **Portability:** The script must be self-contained and run directly from the backup drive without any installation.

## 4. Unique Selling Proposition (USP)

*   **What makes this different or better than existing solutions?**

    Unlike generic backup software or automated cloud sync tools, this script is purpose-built for the DLS ecosystem. It's lightweight, transparent, and designed for a specific, deliberate, on-demand workflow. Its portability makes it ideal for creating secure, offline-capable backups.

*   **Core value proposition for the user?**

    It offers a targeted, no-fuss solution for adding an essential layer of local, physical redundancy for your most critical digital assets.

## 5. Assumptions About Users

*   **Assumptions about users' tech skills, motivations, technology access?**
    *   Users are comfortable with the command line.
    *   Users can edit a simple configuration file to define file paths.
    *   Users understand the concept of mounting/unmounting a portable drive.
    *   Users are motivated to perform deliberate, manual backup actions for their most sensitive data.

## 6. Success Metrics (Product-Focused)

*   **How to measure product's success in solving user problems?** *(User-centric KPIs)*
    *   Zero instances of failed backups that were not clearly logged with a discernible reason.
    *   Positive user feedback confirming the simplicity and reliability of the on-demand backup process.
    *   The script is successfully adopted as part of the user's manual data security rituals.
