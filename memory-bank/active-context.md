# Active Context

## Current Focus
The project's current focus is on ensuring all documentation and project memory accurately reflect the state of the core `password_backup.sh` script. This involves a thorough review and update of the Memory Bank files following recent significant development and refactoring.

## Recent Changes
*   Developed the first complete, functional version of `scripts/password_backup.sh`.
*   Refactored the script to be more modular by sourcing `scripts/utils/logging_utils.sh` and `scripts/utils/messaging_utils.sh`.
*   The script now correctly finds the newest versions of files when source patterns match multiple files.
*   Finalized documentation mentioning the relation with the other two scripts within the larger DLS project.
*   Added `scripts/EXAMPLE_OUTPUT.txt` to demonstrate the script's user-facing output.

## Next Steps

*   **1. Review Core Documentation:** Update the main `README.md` file to be consistent with the script's features and usage.
*   **2. Finalize Configuration:** Ensure the `scripts/password-backup.config.example` is complete and accurate.
*   **3. Update `.gitignore`:** Add `password-backup.config` and `logs/` to the `.gitignore` file.
*   **4. Manual Testing:** Develop and execute a manual test plan to verify all features and edge cases.
