# Development Status

## Overall Status
The project is in the refinement and documentation phase. The core script (`password_backup.sh`) is feature-complete and has been successfully refactored for modularity. The current focus is on ensuring all supporting documentation accurately reflects the script's functionality.

## What Works
*   The `password_backup.sh` script is functionally complete.
*   Configuration is successfully loaded from `password-backup.config`.
*   The script correctly identifies source files, including using wildcards and finding the newest version among duplicates.
*   File copying is handled robustly by `rsync`.
*   Logging and user messaging are handled by modular utility scripts (`logging_utils.sh`, `messaging_utils.sh`).
*   A lock file mechanism (`flock`) prevents concurrent script execution.
*   Dependencies (`rsync`, `flock`, `lsof`, `hostname`) are checked before execution.

## What's Left
*   **Documentation:**
    *   Review and update all Memory Bank files to align with the current project state.
    *   Review and update the `README.md`.
*   **Testing:**
    *   Develop and execute a manual test plan to verify all features and edge cases.
*   **Repository Management:**
    *   Update `.gitignore` to exclude `password-backup.config` and `logs/`.

## Issues
*   No known technical issues at the moment. The primary challenge is to ensure the script is robust and handles file system interactions gracefully.
