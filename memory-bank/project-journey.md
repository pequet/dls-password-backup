# Project Journey

## Core Motivation

To create a simple, robust, and transparent tool that empowers a user to maintain a secure, on-demand local backup of their most critical digital assets (password databases), strengthening their overall digital life security with a key layer of controlled redundancy.

## Standard Project Milestones

**Phase 1: Conception & Setup**
- [x] M01: **Project Idea Defined & Motivation Documented:** The "Core Motivation" section above is filled out.
- [x] M02: **Environment Setup:** Memory Bank and project structure initialized.
- [x] M03: **Version Control Init:** `git` is initialized in the repository.
- [ ] M04: **First Private Commit:** The initial project state has been committed locally.
- [x] M05: **Framework/Ruleset Established:** The core memory bank files and AI rules are in place.

**Phase 2: Core Development**
- [x] M06: **Draft First Script Version:** Implement the initial `scripts/password_backup.sh` with basic config loading and file copying logic for a single file.
- [x] M07: **Implement Core Logic:** Add logic for handling multiple source files and wildcard expansion.
- [x] M08: **Implement Robustness Features:** Add error handling, path validation, and logging to a file.
- [x] M09: **Refine User Feedback:** Improve on-screen messages, progress indicators, and final summary report.
- [x] M10: **Add Concurrency Lock:** Integrate `flock` to prevent simultaneous script execution.

**Phase 3: Refinement & Testing**
- [ ] M11: **Create Test Plan:** Define a manual test plan covering various scenarios (file not found, file in use, config errors, successful copy).
- [ ] M12: **Perform Integration Testing:** Execute the manual test plan to ensure all parts of the script work together correctly.
- [ ] M13: **Document Core Systems:** Write the project `README.md` to clearly explain setup, usage, and troubleshooting.
- [ ] M14: **Perform First Code Refactor Pass:** Review the completed script for clarity, efficiency, and adherence to style guides.
- [ ] M15: **Final Polish:** Review all user-facing strings and log messages for clarity and consistency.

**Phase 4: Release & Iteration**
- [ ] M16: **First Public Commit / Release Candidate:** The first version is ready for public view or testing.
- [ ] M17: **README & Public Documentation Ready:** The project's public-facing documentation is complete.
- [ ] M18: **Project Published/Deployed:** The project is live and accessible on GitHub.
- [ ] M19: **Address Post-Release Feedback/Bugs:** Fix any issues discovered after initial release.
- [ ] M20: **Define Next Major Milestone or Feature:** Plan for future enhancements (e.g., new configuration options, improved reporting).

## Active Quests & Challenges
